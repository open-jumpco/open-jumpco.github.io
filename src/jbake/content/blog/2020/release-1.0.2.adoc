We are excited to announce the release of KFSM 1.0.2

* This release adds support for suspending functions. This will allow for async functions and use in UI frameworks.
* This release also adds a timeout transition. This type of transition will create a timer when the relevant state is entered and trigger
when the timeout has been reached. The transition can also include a guard that will determine if the transition will actually trigger.
* This release finalizes the Gradle plugin for the Visualization

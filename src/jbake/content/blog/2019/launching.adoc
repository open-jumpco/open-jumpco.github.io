summary=JumpCO is launching Open JumpCO initiative.
~~~~~~

link:https://jumpco.io[JumpCO] has developed a lot of code over the last 15-20 years.
A portion of this code is not specific to any customer requirements and is useful across projects.
Harvesting and publishing such code as open source projects and libraries may be useful beyond JumpCO and to the community at large.

Join us on this journey and suggest ways in which we can improve the process of contribution and collaboration.

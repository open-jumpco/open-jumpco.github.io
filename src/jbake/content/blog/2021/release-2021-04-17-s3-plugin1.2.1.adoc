In this release:

* We added a configuration option named `compareContent` that will compare the loacal and remote content before updating. This is an alternative to `overwite = true` will always update and `overwrite - false` will always ignore updates if the remote already exists. *`overwrite = true` will take precedence to `compareContent = true`*

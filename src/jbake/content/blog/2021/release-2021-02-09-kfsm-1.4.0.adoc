~~~~~~

Why did we skip from 1.0.2 to 1.4.0?

* We decided to switch it up to use the 1.4 to denote the version of Kotlin we rely on.
* This release doesn't add any new features and should provide for upgrading without any impact.

We plan to start testing with Kotlin 1.4.30 before looking any new features.
